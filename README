-- ETORRENT --

ETORRENT is a bittorrent client written in Erlang. The focus is on
robustness and scalability in number of torrents rather than in pure
speed. ETORRENT is mostly meant for unattended operation, where one
just specifies what files to download and gets a notification when
they are.

ETORRENT was mostly conceived as an experiment in how easy it would be
to write a bittorrent client in Erlang. The hypothesis is that the
code will be cleaner and smaller than comparative bittorrent clients.

-- GETTING STARTED WITHOUT INSTALLING --

1. run 'make -f Makefile.init'. This calls autoconf and friends.
2. run './configure'
2.5. mkdir lib/etorrent-1.0/ebin
   This is needed for the correct creation of ebin files. I'll fix this
   later.
3. run 'make' (These steps are not necessary for the latter)
4. cd into lib/etorrent-1.0/src and run 'erlc *.erl'
5. copy /etc/etorrent.config into the src dir and edit it to your liking.
   Note that the directory for watching torrents and the directory for
   error logs should exist (or things get nasty).
6. run 'erl -pa . -config etorrent.config -sname etorrent -s etorrent_app'
7. drop a .torrent file in the watched dir and see what happens.

-- GETTING STARTED WITH INSTALLING --

NOTE: This method has not yet seen heavy testing. It can be made a lot
      better than it is.

1. make -f Makefile.init
2. ./configure
3. make
4. make install (as root)
5. edit ${prefix}/etc/etorrent.config to your liking
6. run ${bindir}/etorrentctl start

-- REPORTING BUGS --

Google has an issue tracker at:

Use that for bug reports. I'll get to them as soon as I can.
