TODO:

· GH/jlouis/etorrent_core#8 Fix the problem when completing a torrent:
	  {{badarg,[{etorrent_peerstate,choked,2,
	                              [{file,"src/etorrent_peerstate.erl"},
	                               {line,120}]},
	          {etorrent_peer_control,handle_message,2,
	                                 [{file,"src/etorrent_peer_control.erl"},
	                                  {line,535}]},
	          {etorrent_peer_control,handle_cast,2,
	                                 [{file,"src/etorrent_peer_control.erl"},
	                                  {line,319}]},
	          {gen_server,handle_msg,5,[{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,607}]},
	          {proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3,[{file,"proc_lib.erl"},{line,227}]}]},
	 [{gen_server,terminate,6,[{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,747}]},
	  {proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3,[{file,"proc_lib.erl"},{line,227}]}]}

· Test single-torrent download of something
	This ought to work if we try it out. Let us try with an ubuntu image:
	
	http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-12.04.1-alternate-i386.iso.torrent

· Split webui into its own piece.
	There is no need to have this in the main etorrent application, since it is a thing
	which is UI.
· Consider how to split etorrent_core into multiple pieces.
	· DHT
	· WebUI stuff
· Think about how to run a system like cascadae together with etorrent.
  	· Analysis:
	  Obviously, we should not need to have a dependency on cascadae in etorrent.
	  It is the other way around: cascadae should use etorrent as a dependency, specifically
	  it should be etorrent_core.
	
	  Also, etorrent should not have to be bound together with cascadae. It is the wrong
	  type of coupling we are looking into there. Instead, we would like to have a thin
	  modular layer of commands which can be used by cascadae to communicate
	  with etorrent_core and obtain information about it.
	· Solution:
	  Make etorrent non-dependent on cascadae. We should be able to build a release
	  entirely without any mention of it. Otherwise we failed decoupling.
· Ranch support, see GH/jlouis/etorrent_core#5
· Wrong supervisor kills, see GH/jlouis/etorrent_core#7

DONE:

· Make new dialyzer code part of etorrent
· Make it possible to dialyze etorrent again.
	The problem here is mimetypes which can not be dialyzed,
	so we probably need to exclude it from the list of things we want
	to consider when we are running dialyzer checks.
· Make etorrent_core non-dependent on cascadae.
	This should not be the case.
· GH/jlouis/etorrent#136
  · This makes the release construction fail
· GH/jlouis/etorrent_core#4
  · Make the code compile again
	This requires a step where the cascadae code gets updated.
	We have prodded Mr. Uvarov about it.
· Fix the following error: GH/jlouis/etorrent_core#6
	(etorrent@127.0.0.1)1> 2012-10-14 18:04:22.347 [error] <0.1072.0>

· Test etorrent
	· First step: Compile Erlang for Myrddraal
	· Second step: Compile etorrent on Myrddraal so we have a working beast.
	· Third step: Test etorrent on Myrddraal, make sure the correct hole is punched in the FW
	  There is a hole in the firewall.
