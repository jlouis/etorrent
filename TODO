MANTRA: Handle most of the stuff in the torrent_peer code before
moving on to other parts. What is made here dictates the layout of the
rest of the code.

MANTRA: ets tables have processes before them to manage them easily.

UNDECIDED: Merge filesystem and piecemap into the same erlang process?
It should only be done if piecemap is a single ets table and then it
is not even clear it should be done.

* Make torrent_piecemap request data in a rarest first scheme.
Currently torrent_piecemap requests data in a scheme which is
"pick-random-piece". It should use rarest first instead to drive
up the download speed and make torrent health better.

* Implement seeding
We are not doing anything specific to take care of seeding right
now. This must obviously be cared for.

* Implement torrent_piecemap:pieces_downloaded/1
The function asks to the piecemap what pieces we have downloaded. We
must return a correct answer.

* Implement code for putback when a connection dies.
If a connection dies, all pieces on its request table should be
remapped to be eligible for others to work on.

* Think about generic piece/chunk management in the filesystem
This has to be thought through!

* Set torrent_id in torrent_peer
We have added torrent_id to the torrent peer code. But we have not
given it any value yet.

* Fix connection_manager
We need to fix the state code for the connection manager. It has some
state tables that obviously needs to be managed. But it has to be
simplified a lot. And it really can. Mapping of pids to torrents and
peerids should be handled by a separate process which only has this as
the primary goal.

* Filesystem management
We need FS management

* Check if a torrent is duplicate.
We must check if a given torrent file which has just been added is a
duplicate of a torrent we already manage. If this is the case, then we
should just ignore it.

* Reduce the number of ets tables
Fix and reduce the number of ets tables to a constant amount. This
will allow us to scale into post-1000 concurrent torrents.

* Add license facts

* Add author facts
