-- This is a list of what To Do before a release is ready to be made.
--   Keep the style please. Can be read with emacs org-mode
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Move the piece-chunking code up from the peer connections.
  It should not be the case that the individual peer connection
  processes are responsible for managing the chunking of pieces. It
  should be handled in the process overseeing all peer connections. We
  will need some pretty tough changes to make this work correctly.

* We seem to be passing around a master_pid we are not using anymore.
  Consider killing this master pid!

* Consider making the histogram into mnesia
  Rather than using a histogram as it is now, consider rewriting
  it into mnesia tables. This would, hopefully, make for some much
  better code that is smaller than now.

* DOCUMENTATION!
- Pick functions at random, and document what they are doing.
  It is /especially/ important to document library calls and
   non-standard internal functions in OTP modules.

VERSION ++ (Not decided yet)
------------------------------------------------------------

* Use Edoc
- This takes time, so pick a single module at a time and correct it

* TorrentPeerMaster
- Figure out a better choking/unchoking algorithm.
  The current algorithm is the original one. We should look for a
   better algorithm and implement that. Suggestions for digging:
     ** Azureus
     ** Mainline
     ** Bittornado
     ** rtorrent

* Cleanups
- Decide what to do if we connect multiply to the same IP

* Temporary IP-ban on errors
  If we find an error on a given peer, ban him temporarily for some
   time.

* ROBUSTNESS
- In general, robustness is not really taken care of. We ought to make
  the system more robust by not relying so much on Pids etc. 
- What happens if process X dies
  Go through all processes, and think about what happens if it
   dies. Ensure that the system is robust.
