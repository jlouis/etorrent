TEST

MANTRA: Processes are autonomous if they can be.

MANTRA: ets tables have processes before them to manage them easily.

UNDECIDED: Merge filesystem and piecemap into the same erlang process?
It should only be done if piecemap is a single ets table and then it
is not even clear it should be done.

GROUPS OF EFFORT:

* TESTS!

* Supervisors
It may be possible to use many more supervisor processes to keep track
of other processes we do need.

* Connection management
** Implement seeding
We are not doing anything specific to take care of seeding right
now. This must obviously be cared for.
** Implement torrent_piecemap:pieces_downloaded/1
The function asks to the piecemap what pieces we have downloaded. We
must return a correct answer.
** Implement code for putback when a connection dies.
If a connection dies, all pieces on its request table should be
remapped to be eligible for others to work on.
** Set torrent_id in torrent_peer
We have added torrent_id to the torrent peer code. But we have not
given it any value yet.
** Fix connection_manager
We need to fix the state code for the connection manager. It has some
state tables that obviously needs to be managed. But it has to be
simplified a lot. And it really can. Mapping of pids to torrents and
peerids should be handled by a separate process which only has this as
the primary goal.
** Check if a torrent is duplicate.
We must check if a given torrent file which has just been added is a
duplicate of a torrent we already manage. If this is the case, then we
should just ignore it.

* General stuff
** Reduce the number of ets tables
Fix and reduce the number of ets tables to a constant amount. This
will allow us to scale into post-1000 concurrent torrents.
** Add license facts
** Add author facts

VERSION 2.0
------------------------------------------------------------
* Make torrent_piecemap request data in a rarest first scheme.
Currently torrent_piecemap requests data in a scheme which is
"pick-random-piece". It should use rarest first instead to drive
up the download speed and make torrent health better.

VERSION 3.0

* Implement the fast extension.
