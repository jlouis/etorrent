* Peer Master
- Implement rounds
  Implement choking/unchoking rounds in the Peer Master.
- Don't build a peer for ourselves.
  Don't try to connect to a peer with the same peer_id as
   ourselves. It would be bad bad zoe! (Spank her!)

* Peer Process
- Write Connection code. (Steal from old).
- Write Handshaking code. (Steal from old).
  The handshake code needs some coercion. Fix it.

* Dirwatcher
- There are some tricks to be played here so we get faster startup.
  Rather than using a timer, base the code on a more direct approach
   where timeouts are used internally. It will greatly speedup and
   simplify the dirwatcher code.

* Connection management
- Implement seeding
  We are not doing anything specific to take care of seeding right
  now. This must obviously be cared for.
- Implement torrent_piecemap:pieces_downloaded/1
  The function asks to the piecemap what pieces we have downloaded. We
  must return a correct answer.
- Implement code for putback when a connection dies.
  If a connection dies, all pieces on its request table should be
  remapped to be eligible for others to work on.
- Fix connection_manager
  We need to fix the state code for the connection manager. It has some
  state tables that obviously needs to be managed. But it has to be
  simplified a lot. And it really can. Mapping of pids to torrents and
  peerids should be handled by a separate process which only has this as
  the primary goal.

* General stuff
- Reduce the number of ets tables
  Fix and reduce the number of ets tables to a constant amount. This
  will allow us to scale into post-1000 concurrent torrents.
- Add license facts
- Add author facts

------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 2.0
------------------------------------------------------------
* Make torrent_piecemap request data in a rarest first scheme.
  Currently torrent_piecemap requests data in a scheme which is
  "pick-random-piece". It should use rarest first instead to drive
  up the download speed and make torrent health better.

* TorrentManager
- Check if a torrent is duplicate.
  We must check if a given torrent file which has just been added is a
  duplicate of a torrent we already manage. If this is the case, then we
  should just ignore it.

* Cleanups
- Decide what to do if we connect multiply to the same IP

* PeerIds
- Is one billion peerids enough? Think about making the number higher
  If the client becomes popular, this is important to change. We can
   /easily/ increase the number to a more correct level.

------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 3.0
------------------------------------------------------------
* Implement the fast extension.
  This will require some thought as there may be a very changed
   implementation in the peer clients.
